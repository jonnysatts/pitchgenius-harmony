    title: "Declining in-store foot traffic",
    summary: "Physical retail locations are experiencing a 23% year-over-year decline in customer visits.",
    details: "Analysis of client documents reveals a consistent downward trend in physical store visits across all locations. This decline is accelerating at a rate of approximately 5% quarter-over-quarter, with particularly sharp drops in suburban locations. Traditional promotional strategies haven't reversed this trend.",

    impact: "This decline directly impacts not only sales but also the effectiveness of in-store promotions, store staff utilization, and inventory management strategies.",
    recommendations: "Implement gaming activations that drive physical store visits through collectible rewards, in-store exclusive content, and location-based challenges.",
    dataPoints: [
      "37% reduction in Gen Z and Millennial store visits",
      "12% increase in online vs in-store purchase ratio",
      "43% of former in-store shoppers cite 'lack of engaging experience' as reason for shopping online"

    title: "Low engagement with Gen Z consumers",
    summary: "Retail brand struggles to connect with younger demographics through traditional channels.",
    details: "Client data shows minimal brand engagement from 16-24 year old consumers across all current marketing channels. This demographic represents a $4.2B annual market opportunity that is being captured by competitors with stronger gaming presence.",

    impact: "A gamified loyalty system tied to both online and in-store purchases could drive cross-channel engagement and increase customer lifetime value.",
