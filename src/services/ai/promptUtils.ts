This is a placeholder for actual website content that would be fetched and processed
in a production environment. In a real implementation, this function would:

1. Scrape the website content
2. Extract key information like product offerings, messaging, branding
3. Format it appropriately for analysis by Claude AI

For now, the Claude analysis will use its knowledge of ${project.clientIndustry} websites
and specifically this URL to generate strategic insights.
